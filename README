CODEBATTLE

It's Mega Startup Weekend. Let's build an awesome game.

Codezi-501 is our lovely war-robot that loves flowers. The player will learn JavaScript by hacking into the robot API to help him make a nice flower garden and who knows, maybe later you can program a whole robot army to smash into other robots.

Codebattle is a game about programming, starting by the basics, we hope wannabies can get some good skills while having a nice time.

Good luck team!
